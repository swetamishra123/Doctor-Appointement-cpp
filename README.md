# Doctor Appointment System in C++

This is a simple console-based Doctor Appointment System implemented in C++. The system allows users to book and check existing appointments with a doctor. It provides a basic menu-driven interface for interacting with the system.

## How to Use

1. **Book Appointment**: Users can book an appointment with the doctor by selecting an available time slot. If a slot is already booked, the system will not allow another booking for that time.

2. **Check Existing Appointment**: Users can check the existing appointments and see the available time slots.

3. **Exit**: To exit the program, you can choose this option. It will ask for confirmation before exiting.
