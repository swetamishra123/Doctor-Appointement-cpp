# Doctor Appointment System in C++

This is a simple console-based Doctor Appointment System implemented in C++. The system allows users to book and check existing appointments with a doctor. It provides a basic menu-driven interface for interacting with the system.

## How to Use

1. **Book Appointment**: Users can book an appointment with the doctor by selecting an available time slot. If a slot is already booked, the system will not allow another booking for that time.

2. **Check Existing Appointment**: Users can check the existing appointments and see the available time slots.

3. **Exit**: To exit the program, you can choose this option. It will ask for confirmation before exiting.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/swetamishra123/Doctor-Appointement-cpp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

   ```

3. Compile the code:

   ./doctor_appointment
   ```

   - You can enter a choice by typing a letter (A to Z) corresponding to the time slot you want to book.
   - If you select a time slot that is already booked, you'll receive an error message, and you need to choose a different time.

## Look-Alike

 ----- Book Your Appointment ----
```

This line indicates that you are in the process of booking an appointment.

```

This line shows the available time slots for booking.

```plaintext
 Appointment Summary by hours:
```

This section is providing a summary of appointments by hours. It will show whether a particular time slot is available or booked.

```plaintext
 A-> 09 - Available
 B->10 - Available
 C->11 - Available
 D->12 - Available
 E->13 - Available
 F->14 - Available
 G->15 - Available
 H->16 - Available
 I->17 - Available
 J->18 - Available
 K->19 - Available
 L->20 - Available
 M->21 - Booked
```

This part of the output is a summary of available time slots. Each letter from 'A' to 'M' represents an available hour. The arrow '->' is used to separate the letter from the corresponding hour. If it says "Available" next to a time slot, it means that appointment slot is currently open for booking. However, in this example, it shows that the time slot 'M' (which corresponds to 21:00) is already booked, as it says "Booked."

Here's an example of the data stored in "appointment.dat" based on the output:

- 'M:SWETA' means that the appointment slot 'M' (21:00) is booked by 'SWETA.'
- 'E:SNEHA' would indicate that the appointment slot 'E' (13:00) is booked by 'SNEHA.'
- 'K:Rajeev' would signify that the appointment slot 'K' (19:00) is booked by 'Rajeev.'

The format appears to be a single character representing the appointment slot followed by a colon and the name of the person who booked that slot.

In this example, you can see that the appointment slot 'M' is already booked, which is why it is labeled as "Booked" in the summary. The user is prompted to select an available slot for booking. If they select 'M' again, it would display an error message indicating that the slot is already booked, and they would need to choose a different available time slot.
